# Isomorphic Node/React

I have realized that node.js is absolutely everywhere, and I'm ok with that. I also realized a while back how badly I want my apps to be isomorphic. I love Rails too, but I see the value of having a separated backend.

This project is me following [this tutorial](https://medium.com/front-end-developers/handcrafting-an-isomorphic-redux-application-with-love-40ada4468af4#.nmmtfiv06) in order to learn node, and how to render a react.js application isomorphically.
